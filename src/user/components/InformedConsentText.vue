    <p>
      I'm Emily Liquin, an assistant professor in the Psychology Department at the University of New Hampshire and I am
      the lead researcher investigating “Learning How to Seek Information” (IRB-FY2025-37).
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2 class="font-bold">What is the purpose of this form?</h2>
    <p>
      This consent form describes the research study and helps you to decide if you want to participate. It provides
      important information about what you will be asked to do in the study, about the risks and benefits of
      participating in the study, and about your rights as a research participant. You should:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Read the information in this document carefully, and ask me or the research personnel any questions,
        particularly if you do not understand something.
      </li>
      <li>
        Not agree to participate until all your questions have been answered, or until you are sure that you want to.
      </li>
      <li>
        Understand that your participation in this study involves you to complete a learning task. In this task, you
        will make choices to gather information. This study will last about 45 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Understand that the potential risks of participating in this study are minimal.</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h2 class="font-bold">What is the purpose of this study?</h2>
    <p>
      The purpose of this study is to better understand how people make decisions about seeking information. We expect
      that approximately 2000 people will participate in this study. To participate, one must be at least 18 years old.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2 class="font-bold">What does your participation in this study involve?</h2>
    <p>
      For this study, you will complete a learning task. Depending on the study, this may involve reading a story,
      solving a puzzle, or playing a game. During the task, you will make choices to gather information. You may also be
      asked to provide your opinions about certain aspects of the learning task. Finally, you will complete a
      demographic questionnaire. The entire study will take approximately 45 minutes. You must be at least 18 years old
      to participate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the materials for this study may have been produced by a generative AI (genAI) tool. In the instructions
      of the study, we will inform you whether you will be reading materials produced by genAI.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should complete the study only once. You will receive compensation for only one set of responses if you are
      eligible to participate in the study. For questions about compensation or eligibility, please contact the
      researcher (information provided at the end of the form).
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2 class="font-bold">What are the possible benefits of participating in this study?</h2>
    <p>
      There are no direct benefits to participating in this study. Indirect benefits may include gaining insight into
      the research process and feeling satisfaction at contributing to research. By taking part in this study, you are
      helping us advance our scientific understanding of how people learn and seek information.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2 class="is-size-5">Will you receive any compensation for participating in this study?</h2>
    <p>
      As compensation for participation in this research study or the alternative assignment, you will receive 1 credit
      hour of research experience towards a psychology course requirement of your choosing. The alternate assignment for
      this study involves reading a short research article related to the study and writing a brief response paper.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2 class="font-bold">Do you have to take part in this study?</h2>
    <p>
      Taking part in this study is completely voluntary. You may choose not to take part at all. If you agree to
      participate, you may refuse to answer any question. If you decide not to participate, you will not be penalized or
      lose any benefits for which you would otherwise qualify.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2 class="is-size-5">Can you withdraw from this study?</h2>
    <p>
      If you agree to participate in this study and you then change your mind, you may stop participating at any time.
      Any data collected as part of your participation will remain part of the study records. If you decide to stop
      participating at any time, you will not be penalized or lose any benefits for which you would otherwise qualify.
      However, you will not receive class credit unless you complete the study.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2 class="font-bold">How will the confidentiality of your records be protected?</h2>
    <p>
      I plan to maintain the confidentiality of all data and records associated with your participation in this
      research. Any communication via the internet poses minimal risk of a breach of confidentiality.
    </p>
    <p>
      To help protect the confidentiality of your information, all of your data will be de-identified after this study
      is completed: your SONA ID number and your IP address will be removed from the data and replaced with a random ID
      number. We will retain a separate data file (which will never be shared) that links your SONA ID number to your
      random ID number. Your name will never appear on any of the records associated with this study. Electronic data
      will be stored in a secure cloud storage system backed by the University System of New Hampshire IT Team. Only Dr.
      Emily Liquin and her lab will have access. De-identified data (which cannot be linked back to your name/identity)
      may be used for future studies or shared with other researchers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The results of this study may be used in reports, presentations, publications, and grant applications. Results
      will be reported in aggregate or using pseudonyms if applicable. Your name and identity will never appear
      alongside any results from this study.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2 class="font-bold">Whom to contact if you have any questions about this study</h2>
    <p>
      If you have any questions pertaining to the research you can contact Emily Liquin, emily.liquin@unh.edu to discuss
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
